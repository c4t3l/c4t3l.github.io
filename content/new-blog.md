Summary: Migrating to pelican static site generator

After a long hiatus I am migrating and updating my blog from using hexo to pelican.  It's written in python.  And it's cool!!  

After looking through my old content, it's apparent that I'm missing some posts.  Maybe I can find some of them cached somewhere?
