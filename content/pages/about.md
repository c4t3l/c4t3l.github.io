Hello!  

My name is Robby.  I've been a Linux systems engineer for the last twenty years.  Projects I have worked on include the following:

* Asterisk VOIP / Telco switching
* Hylafax Software Fax Gateway
* SIP Presence monitoring in tools like SugarCRM
* RPM Builds with the Koji Build System
* Saltstack Configuration Management
* Docker 
* Various Enterprise infrastructure configurations
    - Global DFS Replication
    - XMPP server/client buildouts
    - Automated Configuration Management 

I have also contributed to open source projects like CoreOS, Nagios, Saltstack, and the Linux Kernel.  When I'm not busy working on computer related things you can find me chilling with my wife and four pets - Gizmo, Conan, Ni√±o, and Sid.
